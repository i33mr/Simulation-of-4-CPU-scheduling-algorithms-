# Simulation-of-4-CPU-scheduling-algorithms-
Simulation of 4 CPU scheduling algorithms with calculation of completion time, turnaround time and waiting time (gantt chart provided) using command prompt (no GUI):
1. Shortest Job First (SJF)
2. Non Preemptive Priority
3. Preemptive Priority Scheduling
4. Shortest remaining time OR Preemptive Shortest Job First

Example on the processes entries and the output:

to run an algoritm, you need to compile its file and then run it, for example:
in command prompt, type: javac SJF.java
then: java SJF
